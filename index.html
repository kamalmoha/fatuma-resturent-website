            <h4>About Fatuma Resturent</h4>
           <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the <br> industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and <br> scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <br> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of <br> Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <br> Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
